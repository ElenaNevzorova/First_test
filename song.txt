This is the end, you know
Lady, the plans we had went all wrong
We ain't nothing but fight and shout and tears
We got to a point I can't stand
I've had it to the limit; I can't be your man
I ain't more than a minute away from walking
We can't cry the pain away
We can't find a need to stay
I slowly realize there's nothing on our side
